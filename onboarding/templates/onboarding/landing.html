    <h1>Welcome to the IT Onboarding Process</h1>

        The onboarding process is designed to ensure that new employees have access to the IT resources and tools they need to get started. 
        Please follow the steps below to complete the onboarding process:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Fill out the onboarding form by providing details such as your name, manager's email, job title, department, and site.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you have entered all the required information, click "Submit" to send the form to the IT department for processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you need to save the form and complete it later, click "Save for Later" and return to complete the form at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can view and edit any unsubmitted forms from the "Saved Forms" page.</li>
